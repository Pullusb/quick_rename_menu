Current proposition that may pop-up:  
Cube.002 >> Cube
(only if Cube not exists)

Cube.L >> Cube.R

### why ?

When everything is well named and well ordered the project is better.
but naming is long and boring and stop your often stop your workflow !
This mainly allow you to rename object even in fullscreen without opening 'n' sidebar or seaching in the outliner or properties.
the propositions are here only to be a bit more convenient.
